🌙 RAMADAN GREETINGS GENERATOR 
I just built a Generator that refuses to generate electricity but a welcome ramadan greeting messages.
Welcome to my Ramadan Greeting Generator — your cheerful little app for spreading blessings! 
Just enter your name, age, and preferred language (English, Arabic, French, or Fulani), and get a warm, short, and personalized Ramadan greeting with just the right vibes.

From playful messages for the young to heartfelt wishes for the wise, this app even speaks the message out loud — in the right voice! And yes, i tried to make sure it can write your name in Arabic and other languages too but unfortunately i was unable due to the clumssiness and time! 😄

So, this is Built with React + Tailwind CSS, this app features:

Personalized age-based greetings

Multilingual support 🗣️

Text-to-speech with language detection

Dark/light mode toggle 🌙☀️

Confetti magic

thank you!

May your code be bug-free and your Ramadan full of blessings!
